decada70=Ralph Baer and the Magnavox Odyssey\r\n\r\nRalph Baer is considered by a lot of people as the videogames inventor as we know him. He is the inventor of the consoles. In 1966, he built the first domestic console of videogames. He knew that he wanted to do but he fighted too much years to find companies or investors that trust him to put on the market his first console (Odyssey), which get in 1972. With all of the sales, they managed to sell near of 130.000 of units at the Christmas campaign, a success, that attracted the attention of lots of entrepreneurs, among them Nolan Bushnell.\r\n\r\nThe Atari creation\r\n\r\nNolan Bushnell along with Ted Dabney called \"Syzygy\" as their future company, however, the name was already used for another company, so finally they opted to call the company Atari and it was founded at the 1st of June of 1972.The name of Atari comes from the board game Go, is the name used when the gamers achieve to encircle the opponent's stones and win the game.\r\n\r\nPong borns\r\n\r\nWhen Bushnell worked with Nutting, they learned that that the Magnavox Profit Caravan 1972 was showing a home videogame system, and sent Bushnell to see it. It was there where Bushnell saw the Baer's ping pong game and probably where he got the idea of creating a similar game as he began his time at Atari.Bushnell called it as the name of Pong, it was the best hit ever seen in the videogame industry until that moment, forever changing an industry that last until today.\r\n\r\nThe direct rival of Atari\r\n\r\nWith the hit of Home Pong, lots of companies took to create consoles and electronic devices to play at home in the same way . Magnavox tried again, after the failure of the Odyssey, with the Odyssey 100, another. But Atari now would have a stronger rival: Coleco .Coleco designed a console during all 1975 year: Telstar. It was launched in June of 1976. It was still a Home Pong, but it had a brutal hit because Coleco was the main General Instrument customer, the business that supplied the chips for the console games, and the other companies who asked , didn't have stocks.\r\n\r\nAtari hires Steve Jobs\r\n\r\nAl Alcorn hired Steve Jobs (one of the most known names today in the videogames industry). After doing some trips around the world, Steve started to design a videogame: Breakout. Nolan Bushnell was he who devised it, returning to create a new playable concept from Pong, because in this chance only was a stick and in the other border some blocks where you had to go destroying a ball was bouncing on them.In this moment in Atari were very worried for the chips and the repairs in which it had to carry out on the machines once installed, so it was to maximize the number of chips to be installed in an arcade because for each one of them Atari it saved nearly 100.000 dollars.Breakout was not free of all that and Bushnell asked for volunteers to create the game with the fewest number of chips. Steve Jobs had with his friend Steve Wozniak who worked at Hewlett Packard. At such times both were working at Apple II, but Jobs trust that his frind will help him to reduce the number of chips to use.Breakout ended up being the best game of the year and also the first \"clone\" of Pong getting to be more addictive than the original.Besides Breakout, Atari had another success with Night Driver, that appeared in October. In the game, the road was represented with white squares and contributed a great speed feeling.\r\n\r\nFirst time we talk about violence in videogames\r\n\r\nThis year was the first where the controversy of video game violence rocked the industry with the commercialization of Death Race by Exidy. This game was created by Pete Kauffman, but not under that name, it was called Destruction Derby, in which the players had to try to crash into other cars to destroy circuit.He sold the game to Chicago Coin, who refused to pay royalties, so Kauffman checked the game and did a few modifications. After this, we had to Death Race crashing into skeletal human forms that escaped from a graveyard. Every time that you run over one appeared a small cross at the screen. All this new content made ??in some arcades will refuse to expose the game, which it made Exidy sold only 1000 machines to everyone.\r\n\r\nNew companies appear\r\n\r\nIn 1976, appeared also other companies with consoles like the Channel F from Fairchild. In this machine you could play to different games saved each one of them in interchangeable cartridges.Like other machines, the memory Channel F had different games like Pong, but you could buy separately games coming in a plastic cartridges, each one with a microchip which allowed to put it in the machine could play the game coming engraved inside.This console wasn't too successful, sales increasing to 21 cartridges before selling the rights to Circ\u00F3n, that developed 5 cartridges more and surrended the project. It certainly changed the industry forever. Instantly all companies announced new machines would continue this scheme, and as always Atari who was best adapted to changes.\r\n\r\nNintendo makes its appearance\r\n\r\nTogether with Mitsubishi Electrics pulled on sale in June Nintendo Game Tv. It allowed to play 6 different versions of Light Tennis game, which was an improved version and four Pong colours ( the game's right trated with Magnavox). It didn't wear cartridges, the games were included inside the console's memory. It allowed to play with two players at the same time.The gamers controlled the games bar with disks attached directly to the machine. It sold millions of copies at 8,300 yen each one.That year went to work as designer Shigeru Miyamoto artwork for the arcades. The character who would become important for the history of the company.\r\n\r\nTaito releases Space Invaders\r\n\r\nToshihiro Nishikado was one of the programmers of Taito, and one of his projects came up with the idea of ??a barricaded behind a trench soldier, that fired the ranks of enemies coming towards him. But the company thought it was too violent, and could cause problems , so he decided to change to humans by aliens and spaceships. In such a way, naci\u00F3 was born Space Invaders in 1978, the arcade that made know videogames to the world. In this game , the player (behind cosmic shields ) should beat 4 rows of Martians that whenever approached him faster and faster. But its main innovation was during a few years that would be very important to the game : The Hi\u00AD Score.The humans we have an instinct for overcoming, so lot of people tried to beat the record and place their score into the machine.Space Invaders was an absolute hit, coming to cause the Japanese government quadrupling production yen coins, by its scarcity due the game. But it wasn't a hit in Japan, but also through Midway he came to America with identical results. The videogame came out of the bars and arcades centers and made ??the leap to several businesses. Everybody wanted a \r\n\r\nSpace Invaders machine.\r\n\r\nThe first Easter Egg Easter eggs are hidden elements inside a product. In the software world is very common to find Easter eggs, from games hidden within text editors even photos of the programmers in a video game.The first known Easter Egg in the Videogames World appeared in 1978 in the game Adventure of Atari. This egg was a hidden room containing the name of the game programmer , Warren Robinett. Because the games only showed the name of the company and never the name of the developer of the game, Warren, disturbed for this he decided to include his name in the same set of hidden, and when a player finally wrote to Atari about the room with the name of Warren, this was no longer within the company.\r\n\r\nAtari launch Asteroids\r\n\r\nIt was the result of an idea of Lyle Rains and Ed Logg. He was one of the biggest hits in the history of video games in the United States and became Atari in good company so far.The goal was to shoot and destroy asteroids without any fragment were to crash into the ship that we controlled. Players had a shutter button and the ability to turn the ship around its own axis.Each screen facing us four giant asteroids. If we fired separated into two medium and these in turn into two small . In total could reach be on display until 16 asteroid traveling at different speeds through space.\r\n\r\nNamco releases Pac \u00ADMan\r\n\r\nIt was developed by Namco and designed by Toru Iwantani. It is said that one night Toru with friends eating pizza, took the first piece and look how that was, Pac\u00ADMan was born.The game meant a total revolution in video games that probably will not happen again. The was so successful that it is to him a cover story in Time Magazine , a series of cartoons and a song.The name of the game was originally Puck \u00ADMan, derived from the Japanese word \" Paku \u00AD Paku \" which means eating , but over the American market was renamed by the similarities of words and Fuck Puck.
