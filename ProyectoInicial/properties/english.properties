decada70=Ralph Baer and the Magnavox Odyssey\r\n\r\nRalph Baer is considered by a lot of people as the videogames inventor as we know him. He is the inventor of the consoles. In 1966, he built the first domestic console of videogames. He knew that he wanted to do but he fighted too much years to find companies or investors that trust him to put on the market his first console (Odyssey), which get in 1972. With all of the sales, they managed to sell near of 130.000 of units at the Christmas campaign, a success, that attracted the attention of lots of entrepreneurs, among them Nolan Bushnell.\r\n\r\nThe Atari creation\r\n\r\nNolan Bushnell along with Ted Dabney called \"Syzygy\" as their future company, however, the name was already used for another company, so finally they opted to call the company Atari and it was founded at the 1st of June of 1972.The name of Atari comes from the board game Go, is the name used when the gamers achieve to encircle the opponent's stones and win the game.\r\n\r\nPong borns\r\n\r\nWhen Bushnell worked with Nutting, they learned that that the Magnavox Profit Caravan 1972 was showing a home videogame system, and sent Bushnell to see it. It was there where Bushnell saw the Baer's ping pong game and probably where he got the idea of creating a similar game as he began his time at Atari.Bushnell called it as the name of Pong, it was the best hit ever seen in the videogame industry until that moment, forever changing an industry that last until today.\r\n\r\nThe direct rival of Atari\r\n\r\nWith the hit of Home Pong, lots of companies took to create consoles and electronic devices to play at home in the same way . Magnavox tried again, after the failure of the Odyssey, with the Odyssey 100, another. But Atari now would have a stronger rival: Coleco .Coleco designed a console during all 1975 year: Telstar. It was launched in June of 1976. It was still a Home Pong, but it had a brutal hit because Coleco was the main General Instrument customer, the business that supplied the chips for the console games, and the other companies who asked , didn't have stocks.\r\n\r\nAtari hires Steve Jobs\r\n\r\nAl Alcorn hired Steve Jobs (one of the most known names today in the videogames industry). After doing some trips around the world, Steve started to design a videogame: Breakout. Nolan Bushnell was he who devised it, returning to create a new playable concept from Pong, because in this chance only was a stick and in the other border some blocks where you had to go destroying a ball was bouncing on them.In this moment in Atari were very worried for the chips and the repairs in which it had to carry out on the machines once installed, so it was to maximize the number of chips to be installed in an arcade because for each one of them Atari it saved nearly 100.000 dollars.Breakout was not free of all that and Bushnell asked for volunteers to create the game with the fewest number of chips. Steve Jobs had with his friend Steve Wozniak who worked at Hewlett Packard. At such times both were working at Apple II, but Jobs trust that his frind will help him to reduce the number of chips to use.Breakout ended up being the best game of the year and also the first \"clone\" of Pong getting to be more addictive than the original.Besides Breakout, Atari had another success with Night Driver, that appeared in October. In the game, the road was represented with white squares and contributed a great speed feeling.\r\n\r\nFirst time we talk about violence in videogames\r\n\r\nThis year was the first where the controversy of video game violence rocked the industry with the commercialization of Death Race by Exidy. This game was created by Pete Kauffman, but not under that name, it was called Destruction Derby, in which the players had to try to crash into other cars to destroy circuit.He sold the game to Chicago Coin, who refused to pay royalties, so Kauffman checked the game and did a few modifications. After this, we had to Death Race crashing into skeletal human forms that escaped from a graveyard. Every time that you run over one appeared a small cross at the screen. All this new content made ??in some arcades will refuse to expose the game, which it made Exidy sold only 1000 machines to everyone.\r\n\r\nNew companies appear\r\n\r\nIn 1976, appeared also other companies with consoles like the Channel F from Fairchild. In this machine you could play to different games saved each one of them in interchangeable cartridges.Like other machines, the memory Channel F had different games like Pong, but you could buy separately games coming in a plastic cartridges, each one with a microchip which allowed to put it in the machine could play the game coming engraved inside.This console wasn't too successful, sales increasing to 21 cartridges before selling the rights to Circ\u00F3n, that developed 5 cartridges more and surrended the project. It certainly changed the industry forever. Instantly all companies announced new machines would continue this scheme, and as always Atari who was best adapted to changes.\r\n\r\nNintendo makes its appearance\r\n\r\nTogether with Mitsubishi Electrics pulled on sale in June Nintendo Game Tv. It allowed to play 6 different versions of Light Tennis game, which was an improved version and four Pong colours ( the game's right trated with Magnavox). It didn't wear cartridges, the games were included inside the console's memory. It allowed to play with two players at the same time.The gamers controlled the games bar with disks attached directly to the machine. It sold millions of copies at 8,300 yen each one.That year went to work as designer Shigeru Miyamoto artwork for the arcades. The character who would become important for the history of the company.\r\n\r\nTaito releases Space Invaders\r\n\r\nToshihiro Nishikado was one of the programmers of Taito, and one of his projects came up with the idea of ??a barricaded behind a trench soldier, that fired the ranks of enemies coming towards him. But the company thought it was too violent, and could cause problems , so he decided to change to humans by aliens and spaceships. In such a way, naci\u00F3 was born Space Invaders in 1978, the arcade that made know videogames to the world. In this game , the player (behind cosmic shields ) should beat 4 rows of Martians that whenever approached him faster and faster. But its main innovation was during a few years that would be very important to the game : The Hi\u00AD Score.The humans we have an instinct for overcoming, so lot of people tried to beat the record and place their score into the machine.Space Invaders was an absolute hit, coming to cause the Japanese government quadrupling production yen coins, by its scarcity due the game. But it wasn't a hit in Japan, but also through Midway he came to America with identical results. The videogame came out of the bars and arcades centers and made ??the leap to several businesses. Everybody wanted a \r\n\r\nSpace Invaders machine.\r\n\r\nThe first Easter Egg Easter eggs are hidden elements inside a product. In the software world is very common to find Easter eggs, from games hidden within text editors even photos of the programmers in a video game.The first known Easter Egg in the Videogames World appeared in 1978 in the game Adventure of Atari. This egg was a hidden room containing the name of the game programmer , Warren Robinett. Because the games only showed the name of the company and never the name of the developer of the game, Warren, disturbed for this he decided to include his name in the same set of hidden, and when a player finally wrote to Atari about the room with the name of Warren, this was no longer within the company.\r\n\r\nAtari launch Asteroids\r\n\r\nIt was the result of an idea of Lyle Rains and Ed Logg. He was one of the biggest hits in the history of video games in the United States and became Atari in good company so far.The goal was to shoot and destroy asteroids without any fragment were to crash into the ship that we controlled. Players had a shutter button and the ability to turn the ship around its own axis.Each screen facing us four giant asteroids. If we fired separated into two medium and these in turn into two small . In total could reach be on display until 16 asteroid traveling at different speeds through space.\r\n\r\nNamco releases Pac \u00ADMan\r\n\r\nIt was developed by Namco and designed by Toru Iwantani. It is said that one night Toru with friends eating pizza, took the first piece and look how that was, Pac\u00ADMan was born.The game meant a total revolution in video games that probably will not happen again. The was so successful that it is to him a cover story in Time Magazine , a series of cartoons and a song.The name of the game was originally Puck \u00ADMan, derived from the Japanese word \" Paku \u00AD Paku \" which means eating , but over the American market was renamed by the similarities of words and Fuck Puck.
decada80=Atari license the Space Invaders.\r\n\r\nWas the first time that Atari has licensed a recreative machine. They made a good conversion that allows play 2 vs 2 and it had 112 game modes.Quickly they became into a selder of consoles. And this was the reason what did Atari rich,with $ 100 million and sweeping the competitors out of the market.\r\n\r\nDonkey Kong born\r\n\r\nIn the game we could find a plumber who's name was Jumpman (a bit after we will know him as Mario). This will be the first time where we can see this charismatic character. The objective of the game is rescue his girlfriend from gorilla's claw called Donkey Kong, playing with Jumpman. Nintendo had some problems with universal Studios, because he said that Donkey Kong was very similar as their King Kong, and this was the reason by which they demanded the company. Finally Nintendo finished the juice. The game was a total success, although the good seasons for Nintendo they even were to come.\r\n\r\nE.T .: The worst video game history\r\n\r\nThe film had been released in the United States with a smash hit at the box office and Atari did not want to miss this great opportunity to take profit, taking a game for VCS 2600.They needed 3 months for develop it, just before Christmas of that year. They were so sure of their success of the game that they created too many more units of game than  VCS 2600 consoles was in the market at that time because it is assumed that people would run to buy the console for play the game. The game went on sale and turned out to be bad in every way. With extremely simple graphics, gameplay impossible to understand and a fault in a particular part of the game that did E.T. fell into a pit of dirt and couldn\u2019t be able to go out. The result was more than 5 million cartridges in Atari\u2019s stores that nobody wanted to buy. Storage of so many games costs were huge so they decided to get rid of them secretly burying them in the desert of New Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe Crisis Year\r\n\r\nAtari, despite leading the market, is plunged into an institutional crisis. Meanwhile the video game market, by contrast, was living his best moment. The Video game sales became tripled over the previous year and also account for a business of 3 billion and 25% of American households already own a game system. But in the same Christmas of this year appeared the \"Crisis of 1983\" that mean with serious problems for video game sales. This year was the year of the cinema in video games: For the first time the plot of one movie was included in a video game (Tron). From here they began dating more games based on movies like Star Wars from Atari or the second part of Tron. Another known Game appearing this year was the Dragon's Lair, which was the first game using the Laser Disc technology.  On the other hand, Nintendo launches the Donkey Kong 3, changing the style of their predecessors, and for this reason he didn\u2019t get succes. In October of this year makes its appearance in the ZX Spain magazine, the first Spanish magazine dedicated exclusively to a specific computer, in this case the Sinclair. This magazine was one of the first to publish information about video games in our country.\r\n\r\nNintendo releases the Famicom in Japan\r\n\r\nFinally Nintendo thrown Famicom into the market. But in the world was called NES (Nintendo Entertainment System). It went on sale for $ 100 and at the begin it release was not as good as expected. The console had a lot of countless mistakes that were hung and their catalog of games conversions limited to Nintendo's greatest hits like Donkey Kong or Popeye. After a bit reforms in the motherboard a new units were launched, it were a tremendous success and became the most sold console a year later in Japan.\r\n\r\nThe born of Mario Bros\r\n\r\nWe  already had seen this character in Donkey Kong, but now he had his own game for recreatives. This time not called Jumpman, but Mario. It is said that he was called like that by the strong resemblance to the home of Miyamoto in the building where he was staying in New York when he had to go there. His brother Luigi also appears for the first time. The goal was to clean the pipes of different pests that had hit the game below them.\r\n\r\nThe born of The Spanish Game \r\n\r\nThe first was Indescomp and his wanderings begin distributing the first ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC in our country. But it would also be the first distributing video games creation in Spanish, as were curiously Flea would get more success in England.\r\n\r\nThe crisis of 1983\r\n\r\nAtari, as usual, had not patented the design of their games, and therefore any company could freely design games for their consoles. Hundreds of companies rushed to game production without means or experience or knowledge. For Christmas of this year there is a great number of clones and unknown titles. Today with the explosion of Internet buyers could have informed before purchasing the product, but for that moment was not the case. It was very difficult to distinguish a really good or fun game with another that was bad and boring. Besides all this, Atari at that time already had a lot of competition in the market. There were many consoles: Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Bally Astrocade, Colecovision, Coleco Gemini, Emerson Arcadia 2001, Fairchild Channel F System II, Magnavox Odyssey 2 and Mattel Intellivision. This supersaturation directly affect businesses as they were with a lot of games that can\u2019t be sold and with companies that don\u2019t  have sufficient resources to pay them back or to offer new products. Then the shops begin to lower the sale prices to get rid of excess stock. As a result of all this, in just one year gaming industry went from being more growth to have an absolute crisis. Mattel had 195 million loss, Coleco 258 million. This last with Magnavox left the business. Moreover Atari is located near to the bankruptcy with a loss of 356 million.\r\n\r\nSquaresoft is created.\r\n\r\nDespite the serious crisis hitting the world of video games, on this year is founded one of the most important companies in the gaming history: Squaresoft. As explained later in this article, the company entered a bankruptcy situation after 4 years and was about to disappear were it not for Hironobu Sakaguchi that created the first Final Fantasy, with great success, repeating the company other time to the top. Later, in 2003, Squaresoft merged with Enix, to be renamed Square Enix.\r\n\r\nThe golden age of the Spanish video game\r\n\r\nWhile in the rest world of videogames suffered a crisis, 1984 was a milestone in the history of the game in Spain, as was the year where appeared the first Spanish companies dedicated to entertainment software, making this year the first of what has been become known as the \"Golden Age of Spanish Game\". And also Indescomp releases its second game, \"Fred\".  This year appears Dinamic Software (Dinamic Multimedia from 1993) with games like Yenght and Artist, and Erbe, which is mainly dedicated to the distribution of video games for this age. In November 1984 also born MicroHobby, one of the first Spanish magazine dedicated to video games, but only to the platform Spectrum.\r\n\r\nThe video game industry recovers\r\n\r\nIn this year began to recover the video games. Nintendo released the Famicom in America after the great success in Japan. In America it renamed calling NES, and would remain in the rest of the globe. The most important games of this year were: Pitfall 2 Sega, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and also Empire Strikes Back from Atari, Commando and Ghosts Goblins from Capcom and Dig Dug 2 from Namco . Deserves special attention Tehkan World Cup (one of the first football games). Meanwhile ocean it is done with licenses of movies like Rambo , Cobra, short and Miami Vice. In May of this year starts the publishing of the oldest game magazine in the Spanish territory, MicroMania.\r\n\r\nNintendo releases the Super Mario Bros\r\n\r\nIt was created for the Famicom and designed by Shigeru Miyamoto. As you may have readed, he had already appeared in the games Donkey Kong and Mario Bros, but this game was the one that brought him to stardom and it became the mascot of the main company. Yamauchi had asked Miyamoto to make a revolutionary game using Mario. Shigeru began creating the sprite of Mario and the first screens, but later came up with the idea of convert Mario a bit small (to make it look more like when he appeared in Donkey Kong). He thought he could do that in the game, if he eats a mushroom, he grow up and if it was a flower eaten he can be able to throw fireballs. In this game we can see for first time Peach Princess , Toad and Bowser. He created a before and after in the world of video games because he sold millions of copies and also taking a big hit to the Famicom. It is considered the best selling game of all times, but the fact is that this thing has a \"trap\", since the game came included when you purchase the console.\r\n\r\nTetris is created\r\n\r\nThis game, which will be one of the most important in history was invented by Alexey Pazhintov (with the help of Dmitry Pavlovsky and Vadim Gerasimov) in 1985, inspired by a set of pentominoes, when he was working at the Academy of Sciences in Moscow.\r\n\r\nThe born of Legend of Zelda\r\n\r\nIt was created by Shigeru Miyamoto and released on February 21th of this year for the Famicom in the \"Famicom Disk System\" format. Later he would be distributed out Japan in cartridge format. The story is set in the land of Hyrule where a young boy named Link must rescue the Zelda Princess from the claws of Ganon (evil king). The game had several technical innovations. The most notable was the ability to save progress though you turn out machine. He had a lot of acceptance and went on to sell six million copies through and he became one of the great franchises of Nintendo.\r\n\r\nMetroid appears in NES\r\n\r\nIt was produced by Gunpei Yokoi and the project director was Yoshio Sakamoto. One of the innovations that the game  brought was the inclusion of one female  protagonist (Samus Aran). He was one of the first action game that not having a linear development. Metroid would become one of the Nintendo's flagship game.\r\n\r\nCastlevania is launched\r\n\r\nIt was developed by Konami and first came out in Japan under the name of Demon Castle Dracula for the Famicom Disk System. Later in 1986 would MSX 2 (in this case would be called Vampire Killer) and put on sale outside Japan. However in the United States would not be known until Next, when it was rewritten to run on the NES, and under the name of Castlevania. It was certainly a great saga that continues until today.\r\n\r\nIt appears the first Final Fantasy\r\n\r\nBefore the appearance of the first game of the series, Squaresoft was going through very difficult times in the economy. Hironobu Sakaguchi began an ambitious project which would call RPG Final Fantasy. It is said that this name was because it would be his last game (Final Fantasy), but also there are views that the name was because it was the last game of Squaresoft. The game came out in late 1987 and involved such a success that Sakaguchi had to abandon the idea of \u200B\u200Bleaving this world. From that moment he began to develop new Final Fantasy. Many people think that each game has a different story because the first was thought to be no more sequels. This saga reached its peak with the release of Final Fantasy VII, which gave RPG known many people who didn\u2019t know what was that gender.\r\n\r\nThe birth of MegaMan\r\n\r\nThe basic idea of \u200B\u200Bits creator (Keiji Inafune) was to make a simple game with the elements of the game Rock-Paper-Scissors. On the other hand he wanted that the level bosses were vulnerable to certain types of special weapons. At first it was created for arcades, but eventually ended out for the Famicom. The game is set in the year 20XX. The child robot is created by the Dr.Light. In the game we can see how Dr. Wily steals 6 of the robots created by Dr. Light (Robot Masters), which would be the final bosses of each phase. It swept right out in the United States (sold out the third day of going on sale) and has been for posterity as one of the most popular platforms of that time.\r\n\r\nIt published the first Metal Gear\r\n\r\nDesigned by Hideo Kojima appeared in principle to MSX, but a bit after Konami released a version for the NES, with some changes, (wallpapers had changed and also changed a little argument). In the game we handle Solid Snake with a mission to infiltrate the fortress Outer Heaven to retrieve Grey Fox (who had previously infiltrated into the fortress, but had lost communication with him). Snake end discovering, inside the fortress, a new weapon called Metal Gear. This game presented the idea of \u200B\u200Bsuspense to the public, which was used to sweeping away everything he saw on the screen. This Metal Gear was played in a very similar to the latest versions form. Snake begins operation without any equipment and includes the codec (basic ingredient of the series). The action is shown from an aerial perspective.\r\n\r\nSega launched the Mega Drive in Japan\r\n\r\nSega was watching how his Master System didn\u2019t succeed too in America and the United States, the NES dominated the market and had to do something to fix it. That's when they decided to take a 16-bit console that would be as powerful as the best computers of the time like the Atari ST and the Commodore Amiga. The first name that would be used to this console was MK-1601. He would later be called Sega Mega Drive. Among his catalog we can games like Sonic, Golden Axe, Soleil, Light Crusader, Shining Force, Streets of Rage, Story of Thor, Outrun, Street Fighter 2, FlashBack, Altered Beast, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Super Mario Bros 3 comes\r\n\r\nComes was the last Mario game for the Nintendo Famicom. It was a complete success in sales (selling game separately, because if we expect that the first Super Mario Bros (came with the console, would be the winner in sales) and has been recorded in the memory of all fans. We can also say that Mario as one of his best games.\r\n\r\nThe Abbey of Crime\r\n\r\nRegarded by many as the best game of Spanish creation for years, The Abbey of Crime was a videogame based unofficially in famous novel by Umberto Eco, The Name of the Rose. Created by Paco Menendez (programming) and Juan Delc\u00E1n (graphics), the game was originally distributed Amstrad CPC and also later appear in ZX Spectrum (128 k), MSX and PC under the brand of Opera Soft. With and a high difficulty, the game move us to a monastery where we had to solve a crime playing with the franciscan monk, William of Occam, who for seven days should investigate while it is meeting with the typical tasks of the abbey.\r\n\r\nNintendo launch the Game Boy\r\n\r\nThe Game Boy was presented on April 21, 1989 in Japan and in August of the same year in the United States and Europe, with a great commercial success. He had the name of prototype Dot Matrix Game (DMG). It was designed and manufactured by a division of Intelligent System directed by Gunpei Yokoi. Their objective was to get a console that was small, light, cheap and with a lot of video games. It was the evolution of Game & Watch, but unlike these, Game Boy allowed insert games cartridges with interchangeable. The most famous was the Tetris. Surely this was the birth year of the most successful handheld console of all time until today, appearing numerous redesigns of the original console. In many sites added sales of this console with the Game Boy Color, resulting in over 100 million units sold. Here we have separated for left everything more clearly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
decada90=The arrival of the Super Famicom.\r\n\r\nGoes on sale one of the most successful game console device that Nintendo has done in its history: We are talking about the Super Famicom, also Super Nintendo outside Japan. The release date in Japan was November 21st in 1990, USA and Europe were patient and wait until 1992. Definitely the triumph of the Super Famicom came because of the awesome catalog that exhibit the potential of the device. Inside this catalog we can find: Super Mario World, Super Mario Kart, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Lufia II \r\n\r\nSega launches Master System II in the USA\r\n\r\nIn 1990, Sega had reached the success with the Mega Drive/Genesis. Then designs the Sega Master System II, a new console more smaller and lighter, but to lower the production costs, lacks the reset button, Audio / Video connector, expansion bus slot and the original card. In an effort to combat Nintendo Super Mario Bros, the new system includes in ROM the game Alex Kidd in Miracle World, and later Sonic The Hedgehog, which were executed if a cartridge is not inserted. Sega turned to promote the new system, but the generation change had already occurred and did not achieve anything. After two years Master System eventually abandoning the Japanese and North American market, although in Europe it held until 1996 and in New Zealand until 1997.\r\n\r\nArrives Super Mario World\r\n\r\nNintendo presented us his new Mario game. He showed a great improvement in graphics, sound and gameplay compared to its predecessors. Also appeared a new character (Yoshi) and Mario with new skills, including the famous layer. We must also say that was among the first games that made up the player to complete 100% (to discover all the secrets). It was launched in Japan in 1990, in the United States in 1991 and the next year in Europe. It was a complete success worldwide and is considered one of the best games ever.\r\n\r\nThe Secret of Monkey Island it's published\r\n\r\nIt was created by Ron Gilbert with Steve Purcell, Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman. Monkey Island was the fifth game of the company to use the SCUMM engine (motor for adventure games created by Aric Willm\u00FCnder and Gilbert). The game chronicled the adventures of Guybrush Threepwood, a young man who came to the island Mele\u00E9 with the intention of becoming a fierce pirate. At the end he have to travel to the legendary Monkey Island to save his love from the laws of LeChuk. This game is a revolution in adventure games, and introducing new products such as the famous battle of insults, or that it was impossible to get killed.\r\n\r\nSonic arrives to deal with Mario\r\n\r\nDuring that age, Sega can't deal with Nintendo and his Mario. In April of that same year Sega got the goal that required the creation of a video game to replace Alex Kidd as the company mascot. They want to sought a character such as an armadillo, an obese gentleman, a dog or a rabbit. But Naoto Oshima finally appeared with a blue hedgehog (the same color as the Sega logo). The difference with Super Mario Bros was the speed and dynamism. The appearance of Sonic was a huge worldwide success and the game would reach 4 million copies sold. In the United States he was chosen as the most beloved character in front of Mickey Mouse and Michael Jordan. Versions for consoles 8 and 16 bits were taken out after.\r\n\r\nThe Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past\r\n\r\nWe are in front of the only game in the series that was released for the Super Nintendo. Originally he planned to be launched in the NES, but later they decided to delay his departure until he got the new console. Arrives during this year into Japan and the next year to Europe and the United States. It was the first Zelda game to have two parallel worlds that Link could travel. It would be the first game of Super Nintendo to use a 1MB memory. It became one of the best sellers for the Super Nintendo with half units spread around the world and more than four million games. Nowadays it's considered by many as one of the best games in the series.\r\n\r\nComes the second part of Street Fighter\r\n\r\nWith this second delivery of Street Fighter started the revolution in the saga. There were many differences with his predecessor. For example, now we had to choose 8 differents characters, 4 bosses and a different ending for each character. Each fighter had different characteristics of strength, speed, techniques and special moves. Worldwide, started to appear arcades with this game . In the US version the names of a few characters were changed. After the success in arcades it became almost every domestic game systems.\r\n\r\nCrisis in the Spanish game\r\n\r\nAfter the arrival of the 16 bits to the European market during the first years of the 90s, many Spanish developers were disappearing slowly because they were stagnant in the 8-bit and unable to adapt to new systems. Only a few as Dynamic Bit Managers can survived. This puts an end to the called \"Golden Age of Spanish Software\".\r\n\r\nGoes on sale Mortal Kombat\r\n\r\nFollowing the success of Street Fighter II the market was filled with fighting game. Between all this lot of games appeared Midway with his Mortal Kombat, a title that was a good alternative. The game consisted of seven fighters and our mission was to become the champion at the Mortal Kombat tournament. There was a wide variety of shots and the game was extremely violent and also we can perform a \"fatality\" (to kill the opponent), which was violent and gore. For the design of the characters they used real actors. This game was criticized for its violence and in some places was even prohibed. But this rather than negatively affect it, what he did is to increase their sales and popularity. He ended up going out for Mega Drive, Commodore Amiga, Game Boy, PC, Master System, Game Gear, Super Nintendo and Mega.\r\n\r\nWolfenstein 3D is created\r\n\r\nWe can't say it was the first game that proved the three-dimensional perspective, but it was the first who known how to use it succeed. In the game we represent William J. Blazkowicz, a spy who was captured by the Nazis and imprisoned in a castle. Our mission is to escape. Regarding the graphics engine: There was no roof or floor or stairs and objects were perpendicular to the player sprites. Even with all this was totally revolutionary as game concept and marked a leap in quality of the computers on the consoles.\r\n\r\nSega launches Mega Drive II \r\n\r\nBasically it was a higher revision of the motherboard of its predecessor, reducing the size, updating and deleting components chips, all to cut costs. It also changed the exterior appearance, and this forced to accessories like the Mega CD or Master System adapter had to also take a review to be adapted to the new console.\r\n\r\nDoom arrives\r\n\r\nFollowing the success of Wolfenstein 3D, Id Software began developing Doom. It was a game that was much more successful than the previous mentioned and which was the base for all FPS (First Person Shooter) that came later. The game was released for PC and was long sales leader at that platform. Technically it was very rough at the time with very good modeled and with a huge map. The game engine was designed by John Carmack. The success of this game was so big that it had conversions for many consoles of the time and of the future like 3DO, Atari Jaguar, Sega 32X, PlayStation, Super Nintendo, Sega Saturn, Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance and XBOX 360.\r\n\r\nThe first FIFA\r\n\r\nEA devoted exclusively to sports games at that moments. This first FIFA was released at Christmas 1993 under the name of FIFA International Soccer (although later became known as FIFA 94). Had a great campaign of marketing, focusing on the new isometric view premiered this game. We could control various national teams (players were not real names) and could play all sorts of tournaments and leagues. Moreover also he had training modes or exhibition game.

Technically not noted for its graphics (they were two dimensions). The sound not was very good. But his strength was in the artificial intelligence he possessed. The game became a bestseller immediately.\r\n\r\nE3 arrives\r\n\r\nThe Interactive Digital Software Association opens the first Electronic Entertainment Expo, better known as E3, which has since been held every third week of May in Los Angeles ( USA ). This exhibition brings together many of the major gaming companies worldwide to showcase their future releases , whether consoles or accessories for these games.\r\n\r\nNintendo 64 arrives to the market\r\n\r\nNintendo had spent years making deals with companies such as Silicon Graphics or Rambus Inc. to manufacture hardware and Rare and Williams for Software.

It also reduced consumption using only a pair of AAA batteries.\r\n\r\nMario goes 3D\r\n\r\nNintendo presents this year , with the arrival of Nintendo 64 the first 3D platform : Super Mario 64. Many people did not convince the radical difference between 2D and 3D graphics. All this meant a change of approach in the way of playing (not the same play in a 2D world into a vast 3D world ) but the game had a great visual quality for the time and good control . It went on to sell over 12 million copies and has come to be considered one of the best games in the history of video games. It has recently come with extras version of this game for the Nintendo DS .\r\n\r\nThe first Resident Evil\r\n\r\nIt came from the hands of Capcom for PlayStation in 1996 , but was later ported to various platforms.

At first planned launch on Nintendo 64, but this console used cartridges for their games, and the work of Square would not fit into that bracket. In the end they chose to launch on PlayStation, which used CD's, and ended up taking three of them. It would be the first time that a game of this saga saw a Sony console. It is released in Japan earlier this year and months later in Europe and the United States. The Japanese were already accustomed to RPG's and Europe and the United States had also left a few who had enough quality. But Final Fantasy VII was a great success compared to previous games in the genre. He unveiled a lot more to RPG's and reaped very good sales, exceeding 10 million units. It was also the first title in the series with characters modeled in 3D and accompanied many video sequences. Many see it as a film made video game. It has been many years since the release of this game and today is considered one of the best ever. Square has continued to launch numerous \"spin-off\" (even an animated film) about the world of Final Fantasy VII and the original game is paid a very high price on Internet auctions and thrift stores. Many people expect Square launch a remake of the game for a new generation console. But for now the company has said it will be.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrand Theft Auto makes its appearance\r\n\r\nDuring this year the first GTA hands of ASC Games presents . Although this game did not have great graphics had a great success thanks to its total freedom of movement and actions over large cities , driving different vehicles and always being outside the law.\r\n\r\nReaches Age of Empires\r\n\r\nThis based on the real-time strategy game arrived in stores in 1997 , developed by Ensemble Studios and published by Microsoft .

We could play from the age of piety to the Iron with a choice of numerous civilizations of the respective periods.\r\n\r\nPresents its latest console Sega : Dreamcast\r\n\r\nIt was released on November 27, 1998 in Japan and a year later in Europe and the United States. He had been marked by the failure of Saturn and the competition would be very hard on PlayStation 2 (which used the huge success of its predecessor ) . There were many factors and assumptions that could explain what happened to the Dreamcast failed the way it did. The truth is that many years later , it is considered as one of the best consoles that have existed .\r\n\r\nNintendo launched the Game Boy Color\r\n\r\nIt was launched to the market on October 23 this year in Japan and , shortly around the world. I had better hardware , graphics and speed than its predecessor. He had a CPU to 8 or 4 MHz (depending on the inserted cartridge ) .The success of this console has its key point that was compatible with all games original Game Boy ( It was the first handheld to be compatible with its predecessor ) . Nintendo also updated the games of the first Game Boy , improving them to be inserted into the Game Boy Color , so they would have a better look at this console. In four years they were released 230 games for this system.\r\n\r\nComes the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\r\n\r\nFew games in history have meaning or they meant what this game meant at the time. It was the first title in 3D Zelda saga and was designed by Shigeru Miyamoto . For many it is the best game ever , but for many others it is not even close. Here we can apply well the saying : \" About tastes there is nothing written ,\" but certainly we must recognize that we are faced with a great game. Known as Famitsu magazines or Edge gave him the first perfect score in history.\r\n\r\nMetal Gear Solid appears on PlayStation\r\n\r\nIt was first shown at E3 1997 and caused a sensation . It was developed by Konami. Its creator, Hideo Kojima was faithful to the original version of Metal Gear but took all the technical possibilities of the Sony console to create the game of espionage and action he had always dreamed of. Out in Japan in 1998 and today is one of the most important in the world of videogames sagas. Many new games based on espionage followed the first steps he took when he appeared Metal Gear\r\n\r\nDoes the first Gran Turismo\r\n\r\nIt came from the hands of Polyphony Digital and was produced by Kazuroni Yamauchi.Es -based driving simulation game. It was the first game that introduced us in the body of a novice driver had to tease out licenses to achieve better and better and powerful cars . To this they are added about the great graphics for its time. This game was the best selling for Sony PlayStation and has had several sequels.\r\n\r\n\r\n
decada00=Sony launches its second console\r\n\r\nIts development was announced in March 1999 and finally went on sale in 2000 worldwide, with a lot of  problems with the distribution, which caused that only a few people could get it at the begin.\r\n\r\nHe had a 294.9 Mhz CPU (299 MHz in the latest versions) and brought a DVD lector for games and movies (and this was one reason that encouraged many people to buy), and was the first console that had USB ports. After a few months he was selling well also we should keep in mind that came from the success he had expected for PlayStation 1 and that this console was compatible with it (improving the speed of loading and smoothing games textures to reach achieve a better graphics effects). But nevertheless, the firsts games of this console was not too good. Sony does not take too long to use their licenses for get games like Gran Turismo, Grand Theft Auto, Metal Gear Solid, Pro Evolution Soccer, Ico, etc., which would be a positive point to sell much more. It would end marking a before and after in the world of video games. Sweeping all rivals like Dreamcast, GameCube and XBOX becoming one of the consoles more sold in history.\r\n\r\nSony redesigns PlayStation 1\r\n\r\nWe started the year telling how the PlayStation 2 came to market, but we mustn?t forget that a few months earlier, Sony introduced us redesigning their first console. It went by the name of Psone, with a more streamlined and smaller design and with some extra peripherals like a small monitor that could be connected behind the console. It was compatible with all PlayStation games and also it brings protection against all mod chips that had gone before.\r\n\r\nShenmue arrive to the Dreamcast \r\n\r\nIt goes on sale in 2000, becoming in the most expensive game developed, with more than $ 20 million spended. In this game we can have the experience of a new way to play, including concepts such as Full Reactive Eyes Entertainment (Free), giving us a lot of freedom and interaction. The initial idea of ??the creator (Yu Suzuki) was to make 17 chapters of this saga. No doubt we are in front of a big game, probably the most memorable of the last console Sega.\r\n\r\nThe new console from Nintendo: GameCube\r\n\r\nIn 1999, Nintendo announced the Dolphin Project. At this time Nintendo 64 had already reached his maturity with the Ocarina of Time and the sales was working good, despite being far from PlayStation. In 2000 the console comes in an event called Space World, while PS2 was already in Japan, and not with good sales. The presentation was very spectacular and the design impressed everyone. Some aspects such as the mini-DVD Matsushita and that was easy for the developers to program it would have been detailed. The videos that were presented left give very good taste for the attendees (Zelda videos, Perfect Dark Zero, Too Human and Metroid). GBA-GC also announced his compatibility with many options in between. The only negative thing was the announcement of the console was delayed until 2001. In the following year E3 games like Eternal Darkness and Starfox Adventures had presented. Finally goes on sale in 2001 in Japan and the United States and in 2002 in Europe. But when it comes to carrying out ,the advantage that PS2 had it was too big and was relegated to second place in sales with the XBOX. They did great games in this console, like Resident Evil, Zelda: The Wind Waker, Metroid, Zelda: Twilight Princess, etc.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Joins: The l\taunch of Xbox\r\n\r\nThe first time this console is announced in 2000. It was the first console in history that came equipped with a hard disk. He has just launched on 15 November in the United States and the following year in Japan and Europe. He had a 733 Mhz CPU. I'd rather have success in America, and in many markets would be at the second top seller. But never could beat the PlayStation 2 and its spectacular sales numbers.\r\n\r\nNintendo bring the Game Boy Advance\r\n\r\nIt was the successor to the Gameboy and Gameboy Color, being able to run almost all of these games. It was launched this year in Japan, the US and Europe and had a 32-bit processor to 16.7 Mhz. Also it had another 2 Mhz processor for run software from previous Gameboy. Like all Nintendo?s portable, ended up triumphing, including a large catalog of games among which we can highlight: Mario Kart: Super Circuit, Castlevania: Circle of Moon, Golden Sun, Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance, Super Mario Advance, Metroid Fusion, Golden Sun II, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Final Fantasy: Tactics Advance, Wario Ware, Castlevania Aria of Sorrow, Metroid Zero Mission, Sword of Mana, The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap, Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories Final Fantasy IV Advance, Tales of Phantasia, Final Fantasy V and Final Fantasy VI among others.\r\n\r\n11 of September\r\n\r\nBetter known as 11S, the fatal attack on September 11, 2001 against the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York affected worldwide and video games weren?t one exception. Shares of many game companies fell (as happened in other economic \tenvironments in the world), many titles were delayed several months and others had experienced hand of censorship, often a purely voluntary basis to avoid negative reactions to them, and even some games were temporarily removed from the stores because they have inadequate content or covers. To cite several examples, Metal Gear Solid 2 deleted scenes that showed the towers game, many games of Spider Man were delayed as this crosses skyscrapers with its web, and Red Alert 2 was removed from stores by its cover.\r\n\r\nHalo comes to Xbox\r\n\r\nLater this year (November) became the most famous of the Microsoft console FPS. He had very good sales like of 5 million units sold.\r\n\r\nKonami takes on sale the first Pro Evolution Soccer\r\n\r\nOn 23 November of this year goes on sale Pro Evolution Soccer, first delivery with this name, but successor of previous ISS Pro Evolution for PlayStation. In Japan it is called Winning Eleven 5 and was the first delivery for PlayStation 2, PlayStation also leaving. At first he did not convince much to users, especially because it lacked licenses that caused the real names of the players, shirts, flags and names of teams stadiums were modified. Besides all this, in the shops it was also FIFA, a tough competitor, rather better known than the Pro Evolution Soccer. But however this game eventually became the best simulator of the year. In the following years it would become a very good alternative EA game.\r\n\r\nThe resurgence of Atari?\r\n\r\nInfogrames makes that year a subdivision under the name of Atari and is dedicated to launch PnP devices for televisions with the great classics of gaming. On the other hand, he returned to the development of video games like Dragon Ball Z, Tycoon City: New York, Enter the Matrix, Path of Neo, Driver, etc.\r\n\r\nPEGI: Too much violent for you\r\n\r\nYears before existed different systems for classifying video games according to age and content, however it was not until 2003 that the current system known as PEGI (Pan European Game Information or Pan European Games Information) was established and It used for the classification of video games and other entertainment software in Europe.\r\n\r\nNintendo presents the GBA SP\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, a new review of GBA, renamed Game Boy Advance SP is presented. This console is the first portable Nintendo to replace the batteries with Lithium Ion battery and has a folding design format. It also has front lighting on the screen and is about half as large as the Advance. Besides all this, the changes to its predecessor are minimal.\r\n\r\nNintendo DS: A super selling console\r\n\r\nIn recent years Nintendo wanted to innovate on consoles, wanted to offer a new way to play, where everything would be based on charts, but in other respects. So they added to the console two screens (one touch), a microphone with voice recognition, a WiFi connection to play online games, etc. Its name means Dual Screen and goes on sale (after being presented at the previous show at E3 2004 in Los Angeles) in November, this year in the United States, a month later in Japan and next year in Europe. When he came out, Nintendo made it clear that this was a new line of portable and did not consider the successor to the Game Boy Advance, although it would be compatible with games of this notebook. Along with the Nintendo DS Lite (redesign of it) it will become the next few years the best-selling of all markets to console today.\r\n\r\nThe first portable Sony: PSP\r\n\r\nSony, from a good position in the market for desktop consoles, saw how Nintendo filled with money from their laptops. At the end they end up deciding to try to steal a piece of this pie. They create a console with some impressive features, incorporating a format called UMD (Universal Media Disk), which allow us to watch movies on the same console. It is similar to a CD or DVD but very small, with a capacity of 1.8 GB. With all this, Sony aims to turn the PSP (PlayStation Portable) into a media center (you could also see pictures and listen to music). The console would have a huge screen with high quality views. And also they would incorporate an analog stick, making it the first laptop in history to include. Finally goes on sale in December 2004 in Japan and the following year in the United States and Europe. It has a 128-bit CPU at 333 Mhz. Today there is a large movement of the scene around this console emulators a lot of systems, apart from many other applications.\r\n\r\nSony presents the redesign of the PS2\r\n\r\nIn September this year Sony unveils a redesign of his second home console. As happened with Psone, it is much smaller, thinner and quieter than the original PlayStation 2. The only thing against it is that, because of its thinness, no place to put a 3.5-inch hard drive and thus, games that used hard disk that are affected.\r\n\r\nReaches 360\r\n\r\nEarlier this year and rumors about its release date and specifications could be heard, although the console devised began in early 2003. The project had several names: PlayStation 2, Xbox Next, Next Box, etc. Xbox 360 and a few days later and logo design: in April, the final name became known. Microsoft announced the price (would go on sale two versions: the Core for $ 300 and the Premium for $ 400). Finally, on May 12, the Xbox 360 was presented in style with a party broadcast on MTV. There are many rumors surrounding this console is unveiled. Finally it goes on sale almost simultaneously (be the first to do so) in Japan, USA and Europe. It has a 3-core Xenon processor with parallel processing which run at 3.2 GHz each.\r\n\r\nLaunching PlayStation 3\r\n\r\nThis year the third console from Sony comes in two versions, one with a hard drive of 20 GB ($ 499) and one with a 60 GB ($ 599), both had some differences between them, but they were practically similar. Later in Korea a version with 80 GB hard drive would be launched. It was presented to the public at E3 2005. At that time said two HDMI and three Ethernet ports, later reduced to one in, presumably to reduce costs would be included. They also presented a knob shaped boomerang, which received a lot of criticism, later being redesigned. His departure for next spring is announced. In March this year a delay until November console is announced. At E3 2006 it is when some games were presented and announced that include HDMI in the two versions. Finally it is released in Japan on November 11 and 17 in the United States. But already it announced a delay in European lands that would take out the March 23 of the following year (according to them due to the production of laser diodes for Blu-ray reader. Because of this delay, many European users complained . Finally would in Europe March 23, 2007.\r\n\r\nThe revolution with Wii\r\n\r\nThe project, initially was called \"Revolution\" (unveiled at a conference of E3 2005), very consistent with what we later submitted Nintendo: A revolution in the way you play. While the command is not shown in this fair. TGS in the same year if the driver would present new Nintendo console, raising great expectations among participants and Internet forums. Wii (Nintendo first, who is named as part of it): later, before E3 2006, the final name of the project is announced. Then, at the Kodak Theatre would show us how it works, they announced the complementary command of Wiimote (the Nunchuk) and showed us some games. E3 2006 came when people could try first console with several games. Nintendo, on this console, bet more on how to play with his revolutionary command in the power of the same console. The main feature is therefore the wireless controller that incorporates (called Wiimote) can detect motion and rotation in three-dimensional space (besides includes vibration and speaker). Just coming to market in November this year in the United States next month in Japan and Europe.\r\n\r\nDS Lite: DS redesign\r\n\r\nIt is put on sale later this year worldwide. Presented a slimmer and lighter than its predecessor, with more colorful with the public. The term \"Lite\" from its name comes from the English word \"light\". Compared with the previous model, Nintendo DS Lite has some less powerful than the previous speaker weighs 21% less. The pointer on the console is a bit bigger and the screens had improvements.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft presents Elite\r\n\r\nThis year, Microsoft has introduced a new model of your console. This is the Xbox 360 Elite. The differences with the Xbox 360 Premium is that it includes a 120 GB hard drive and an HDMI connector. Clearly, with this new version, Microsoft will try even more expensive than the PlayStation 3 from Sony. He left in April in the United States at a price of $ 479.99 and the hard drive could also be purchased separately for $ 179.99.\r\n\r\nSony announces a redesign of the PSP\r\n\r\nDuring the July E3 this year, Sony announced a redesign of its handheld. As news we find that the console will be 33% lighter than before and with more battery capacity. He also incorporate new features like can be connected to the TV through a video output and reduced loading time of games.\r\n\r\nSonic and Mario - Old rivals\r\n\r\nMario and Sonic, the mascots of Nintendo and Sega, respectively, appear together in one hand video game consoles Sega for Nintendo.
decada10=In the history of video games, the eighth generation of consoles is a term that describes the generation of video game consoles that happens to the seventh generation ( Sony PlayStation 3 , Microsoft Xbox 360 and Nintendo Wii ) .\r\n\r\nThe portable consoles begin a new era\r\n\r\nThe eighth generation begins with the launch of Nintendo 3DS in February 25, 2011 , then followed by the Sony PlayStation Vita ,which it was launched on 17 December of the same year.\r\n\r\nPsVita : The great failure of SONY\r\n\r\nPSVita went on sale last December 2011 in Japan , reaching the West in the first quarter of 2012 due to the inability of Sony to make a simultaneous release in all regions, as happened with PS3, again it is leaving behind its European users and Americans to get a console much later that privileged Japanese users .\r\n\r\nEven so, PSvita it has failed to reach one million units sold in Japan, ni en ning\u00FAn otro territorio. The estimated sales of the portable arrive  to  2,5 millions of sold units. A whole nonsense if it is compared with more than 20 million sold 3DS, its most direct rival, that despite carrying a few months the market has accumulated constants sales becoming the most sold in Japan for more than one consecutive year and this summer was the console\r\n(desktop consoles included) the most sold console in whole world. Not only in the hardware PSvita accumulated poor sales, that software alone any game has managed to approach the Million units sold .\r\n\r\n\r\nEverything is the result of that has received the little support console by Sony and the scant interest that occurs between the developers third parties .\r\nIn the past E3 Sony conference , the console received a discreet attention announcing just a couple of spin off games geldings multiplatform .Sony prometi\u00F3 un evento dedicado en exclusiva para PSVita en verano que jam\u00E1s lleg\u00F3... It\u2019s so little the support that they are receiving the portable in the past Tokyo Game Show that its predecessor PSP received further announcement games. That says it all . We are facing a chronicle of a\r\ndeath foretold .\r\n\r\nLaunch and evolution of N3DS\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 2011 it saw the launch of Nintendo 3DS, which allows its users to enjoy stereoscopic 3D graphics without\r\nspecial glasses . The console went on sale with a varied catalog , which included games developed by Nintendo, as Pilotwings Resort or\r\nNintendogs + Cats .\r\n\r\nNintendo did not left its efforts to improve the catalog of Nintendo 3DS throught out the year , giving users the opportunity to enjoy titles innovative and exclusive for Nintendo 3DS , in addition to classic Virtual Console and DSiWare games of 1000 with the launch of Nintendo\r\neShop in June.\r\n\r\nIn the same month the owners of Nintendo 3DS were in luck: the chance to have a great time with a successful classic videogame : The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D . Among the innovations highlighted remastered graphics and new functions as the challenge mode and the control movements.\r\n\r\n\r\nToday the N3DS console features an extensive catalog of games and consoles it is one of the most currently sold.\r\n\r\nNintendo Wii U launch\r\n\r\nThe console first came in 2008 , after Nintendo Wii recognize multiple limitations , such as the general public thought the console was directed to a casual player. With Wii U, Nintendo wanted to re-attract groups of players who felt displaced with Wii. The game designer Shigeru Miyamoto admitted that the lack of HD and poor infrastructure in line also contributed to leave Wii in a class with respect to its competitors , the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.It was decided that the new console should change these details completely.\r\n\r\nWithin the company , there was much debate over how it should be the new console, and the project was scrapped and restarted several times. The concept of a touchscreen control was inspired by the blue light Wii reporting new messages. Miyamoto and his team wanted to incorporate the screen to give more information to the players (similar to the Sega Dreamcast VMU ) . When the development was very advanced, it was expanded to a full screen that could display the game as a whole, a concept that was suggested , but it was not financially viable before.\r\n\r\n\r\nA rough start for XBOX ONE\r\n\r\nThe Xbox One console began to take shape after the release of its predecessor, the Xbox 360. Although specialized media christened as Xbox 720, the first kit de oficial development kit created by Microsoft received the code name Durango and made available to some developers in the middle 2012. However it was not until May 21, 2013 the company made official its existence under the name Xbox One. After this first presentation took place second in the E3 2013 which revealed many of the features of the machine that was already fully playable.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlong with the presentation of the new hardware, Microsoft made other developments represented a significant change in the policies that had applied officer.\r\n\r\nThus, the Xbox One Internet connection required to function, requiring a line check at least every 24 hours and that would otherwise the machine stopped reading the games. Another novelty, affects second-hand market and the possibility of sharing games also limited\r\npreviously acquired by the consumer.\r\n\r\nAlthough  initially firm when implementing all these changes, the company ended up reversing back to the politics that had force Xbox 360. The strong criticism they received together with the fact that their competitors did not apply any of these restrictions is considered as main causes of change in posture.\r\n\r\n\r\nPS4 makes its appearance\r\n\r\nIt was officially announced on February 20, 2013 on the PlayStation Meeting 2013 event , although the design of the console was not filed until 10 June at the E3 2013.9 is the successor to the PlayStation 3 and One competes with Microsoft 's Xbox and Nintendo Wii U . It launched on November, 2013 in the United States and Europe and Latin America was the November 29, 2013 , while Japan was the February 22, 2014 .\r\n\r\nAway from the complex architecture used in the Cell processor of the console PlayStation 3, the PlayStation 4 has an AMD processor 8 cores under the x86-64 architecture. These x86-64 instructions are designed to make the game development on the new console easier\r\ngeneration , attracting a larger number of developers. These changes highlight Sony 's effort to enhance lessons learned during the development , production and launch of the PS3. Other notable features of the PS4 's hardware , including 8 GB of memory Unified GDDR5 , a unit of Blu- ray Disc faster, and custom chips dedicated to audio processing tasks , video and background .\r\n\r\nAmong the new applications and services , Sony launched the PlayStation App application , allowing having a PS4 make smartphones and tablets on a second screen to enhance gameplay or external keyboards for comfort at the time of writing .\r\nThe company also plans to debut with Gaikai , based gaming service in the cloud that hosts content and downloadable games by incorporation button \" Share \" in the new controller makes it possible to share at any time screenshots , trophies , shopping or videos on sites like Facebook , Twitter and stream that is played and see other friends live on Ustream or Twitch , Sony planned placing more emphasis on the social game.\r\n\r\nThe PS4 the first day of its launch console sold more than 1 million consoles only in the territory of the United States.11 At the beginning of the conference press at the Gamescom 2014 , Sony announced that it had sold more than 10 million units of the PlayStation 4 in the world of the users.
